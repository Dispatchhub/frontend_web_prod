          </h3>
          <p className="unageo-regular text-[1rem] md:text-[1.5rem] leading-6 md:leading-8">
            Customers are responsible for confirming the availability of the
            receiver (when sending) or sender (when receiving) before placing a
            delivery order. If the assigned party is unavailable at the time of
            pickup or delivery, additional waiting time or return trip fees may
            apply.

            2. Location Accuracy
          </h3>
          <p className="unageo-regular text-[1rem] md:text-[1.5rem] leading-6 md:leading-8">
            Customers must provide accurate pickup and delivery addresses. Our
            pricing is based strictly on distance. If the exact location is not
            available on the map, the customer must select or describe a nearby
            mapped location that closely represents the intended address. If our
            rider is required to travel beyond the mapped area to locate the
            address, the customer will bear any extra cost incurred as a result.

          </h3>
          <p className="unageo-regular text-[1rem] md:text-[1.5rem] leading-6 md:leading-8">
            Customers must ensure that all phone numbers and contact details
            provided are accurate and reachable. Orders placed with invalid or
            unreachable contact information may be canceled or delayed, and
            DispatchHub will not be held responsible for such outcomes.

          </h3>
          <p className="unageo-regular text-[1rem] md:text-[1.5rem] leading-6 md:leading-8">
            Any extra trips, extended waiting times, failed deliveries, or
            remapping efforts will result in additional charges. These charges
            will be automatically calculated and reflected in the app based on
            time and distance. Customers will be notified of any extra charges
            before they are applied, and such fees must be paid before the
            service is completed or at the time of delivery.

            Customers have the ability to track their deliveries in real time
            through the DispatchHub app. This provides full visibility of the
            delivery process, including the riderâ€™s location and movement from
            pickup to drop-off.

            DispatchHub is not liable for incorrect information provided by the

            unconfirmed recipient/sender availability. DispatchHub shall not be
